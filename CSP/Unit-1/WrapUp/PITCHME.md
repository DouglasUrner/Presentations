## Warm Up

Sort the binary values below into order from smallest to largest:

* A: 10001
* B: 10011
* C: 01111

Could a 5-bit number, be used to encode the colors in a box of 80 crayons?

Note:

* C - A - B
* No, you would need 6 bits, 5 gives you 64 possible values.

## Agenda

* Review unit objectives
* Chapter assessment
* Work time
* Question time

---

## Unit 1 Objectives

* The binary number system and why we use it
* Encoding and transmitting data as binary values

---

## Chapter Assessment

* Tuesday
* 10 mulitple choice questions
* "AP style"

Note:

* Why binary (simple, cheap, easy to build)
* Converting 4 bit values into decimal
* Bits to encode (e.g. how many bits for the alphabet)
* Binary and decimal are equivalent (any thing you can do in one you can do in the other)
* Ordering binary numbers
* Adding a bit doubles the number of possibilities
* Bit-rate (bandwidth) & latency
* ASCII
* Adding bits

## Work Time

* Complete Lesson 7
* Review self-check questions

## Things to Ponder

Why binary?
Converting 4 bit values into decimal (e.g., what is the decimal value of 1101?)
Bits to encode (e.g., how many bits for the uppercase letters and a space?)
Is there anything you can do in decimal that you can not do in binary?
What happens to the range of values in a binary number when you add a bit?
Can you explain bit-rate (bandwidth) & latency?
What is the ASCII code?
